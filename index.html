    <h1>Yazeed Mohamed</h1>
    <p>
        I consider myself an ambitious and driven person. I enjoy being challenged and I'm always setting goals for myself.<br>
        I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and better myself<br>
        in all aspects of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I matriculated in 2020 at The Settlers High School. I then took a three month course in software engineering<br>
        at <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.hyperiondev.com">HyperionDev,</a> where I learnt Python, Java
        and MySql.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interests are technology and software systems. In my free time I strengthen my software engineering and coding skills<br>
        by working on various projects <a target = _blank" href = "http://github.com/YazeedMo">(GitHub).</a><br>
        In the future I see myself leading a successful team of software engineers.
